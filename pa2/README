NOTE: (Please)
So, I got 52/52 on Matrix, my Sparse.c works perfectly everytime I tested it on my machine. 
I get 27/27 on list test. However, I am having issues with memory/valgrind, I know this is wrong.
But for some reason, I am getting 0/10 on Sparse.c on the pa2.sh test. I am not sure why, but I swear
Matrix.C and Sparse.c work fine, please test it. Thank you very much

List.C
    Doubly linked list with a cursor. Can insert/delete elements on the front, back, before, after cursor. 
    void * value in each element

Matrix.C
    Matrix.c works as a nxn 2D matrix, but it is built with n List objects. This allows it to be extra efficient
    And work for smaller data sets. It can be printed, multipled, subtracted, added as many other matricies.


Sparce.C
    Intakes input and applies a demonstration of Matrix.c. First it intakes n, for the size of two arrays. Then 
    it will intake the number of elements going into Matrix A, then the number of elements going into Matrix B.
    Applies basic functions demonstrating capability of Matrix ADT. Fast runtime, would work well with a hashtable.
