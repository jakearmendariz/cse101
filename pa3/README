   each node indivudally and eventaully affect the total outcome of a huge number.


Arithmetic.C
    Uses BigInteger.c to take in an input file with 4 numbers. 1: number of digits. 2: number with that number of digits
    3: number of digits. 4: number with that number of digits
    preforms 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴 + 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐴, 3𝐴 − 2𝐵, 𝐴𝐵, 𝐴^2, 𝐵^2, 9𝐴^4 + 16𝐵^5

Makefile
    Compiles and runs the project under ./Arithmetic input_file ouput_file
