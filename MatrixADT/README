List.C
    Doubly linked list with a cursor. Can insert/delete elements on the front, back, before, after cursor. 
    void * value in each element

Matrix.C
    Matrix.c works as a nxn 2D matrix, but it is built with n List objects. This allows it to be extra efficient
    And work for smaller data sets. It can be printed, multipled, subtracted, added as many other matricies.


Sparce.C
    Intakes input and applies a demonstration of Matrix.c. First it intakes n, for the size of two arrays. Then 
    it will intake the number of elements going into Matrix A, then the number of elements going into Matrix B.
    Applies basic functions demonstrating capability of Matrix ADT. Fast runtime, would work well with a hashtable.
