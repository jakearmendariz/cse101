This was a personal project to implement the Dijkstra's algorithm to my already existing list adt.
Dijktra's algotirithm and path finder within a graph

Overview
Finds the shortest distance between nodes when edges have a weight. See the code for instructions on formatting input file.

FindPath.c
Takes in two files: input, output
In the input it will create a graph then print out the distance and paths of multiple routes to output file

Graph.c
Contains the Graph ADT
Allows users to add directed and undirected components
Use Dijkstra to find distance from any vertex
Returns a path using each nodes parent

List.c
Doubly linked list, used for the adjacency list
Adds inputs in order
